# Mealify
Mealify, a website that I developed from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Mealify is a user-friendly platform designed to satisfy your culinary cravings. It features two visually appealing modes: a vibrant light mode and an elegant dark mode, ensuring a delightful browsing experience for everyone.
